# Research Project - Task definition
As a team we have created a research plan document. This document describes the problem domain, the problem, the research questions and methods. We devided the work into multiple tasks over multiple iterations.

The research questions have been created over three iterations. I created the second iteration of the research questions. After each iteration the content was reviewed firstly by the team itself and secondly by Tony Andrioli.

## First iteration
The first iteration of the research questions was created by Matthew Turkenburg and is as follows:

    1. Can we use this knowledge to determine if people did their 150 minutes of moderate activity in the week data?
        
        a. Can you recognize the lab activities in the week data? 

            i. How do you recognize an activity in the lab data? 
            ii. What features do you need to learn a model to recognize activityâ€™s? 

        b. Can you see patterns in the rest of the data that indicate doing sports? 

    2. How do we measure the intensity of movement in the ActivPAL data? (Without the heart rate information) 

        a. Can you measure the intensity of movement by using a MET value of an activity? 

            i. How do you calculate the MET value of an activity? 

        b. Can you measure the intensity of movement by measuring the Magnitude of acceleration of an activity? 

            i. How do you calculate the Magnitude of acceleration value of an activity?

Tony Andrioli's feedback on this is as follows:
* Do not reference to a person as in "can we" it is the point if a computer algorithm can
* 1.a suggests you only have data collected during lab tests
* At 2. you are not measuring the movement in the data itself. But a computer algorithm is. 

## Second iteration
Second iteration was created by me. Taking into consideration the feedback the second iteration of the research questions are as follows:

    1. How can Machine Learning be used to predict the intensity of activities performed in a lab situation by a person, who is being monitored with Vyntus One and wearing ActivPal accelerometer?

        a. What measurement does ActivPal use for intensity and why? 

        b. Is it possible to extract this intensity measurement values from just Vyntus One data, if so, how? 

        c. Is it possible to extract this intensity measurement values from just ActivPal accelerometer data, if so, how? 

    2. How can Machine Learning be used to predict the intensity of activities performed by a person wearing only the ActivPal accelerometer, based on the data gathered from Vyntus One and ActivPal accelerometer in the lab situation?

        a. Are there one or more explanatory variables in the ActivPal accelerometer and respondents data for the intensity measurement values of main question 1, if so, what are they? 

    3. How can Machine Learning be used to determine whether people did their 150 minutes of moderate activity in ActivPal accelerometer data of an entire week? 

        a. How can Machine Learning be used to recognize the activities, performed in the lab situation, in the ActivPal accelerometer data? 

        b. How can Machine Learning be used to recognize patterns in the data that indicate doing sports? 

Tony Andrioli's feedback on this iteration is:
* Question 3 and subquestions should have a stronger relation to questions 1 and 2.
