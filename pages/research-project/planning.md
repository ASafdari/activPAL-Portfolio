# Planning
## Sprint Plannings
Our team worked with sprints of a week. At the end of each week we would meet to do the Sprint Planning for the next sprint. We would review the items that are on the Product Backlog and either remove them if it is not relevant anymore, leave them there for future sprints or add them to the upcomming sprint to be worked on.

The requirements for each item to be added to a Sprint Backlog are:
* Everyone understands what the item is about
* The item has been priotized
* It is possible to complete the item in one sprint
* There is a teammember assigned to the item

Normally it is also mandatory that the items have an estimation of some sort and acceptation criteria. But we did not implement these requirements because we thought it would cost too much time in proportion to the added value. 

It was my responsibility that these requirements were passed. That is why I would take the lead and share my screen during these meetings. Besides that, this was a team effort.

## Product Roadmap
As a team we also created a global Product Roadmap containing Epics we would like to have finished and when. The creation of this Product Roadmap is also because of team effort. We noticed that in the first weeks we were on track and following this roadmap nicely. I think for the last weeks we underestimated the work of the last items and they took longer than expected.
