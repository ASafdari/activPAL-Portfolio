# Reflection on own contribution to the project
**Situation**

For most of the minor duration The Netherlands was in a lockdown due to COVID-19. This meant for students they were not able to go to school to work on their projects or homework. I understand that working from home for a prolonged period of time might get difficult and many people have a hard time maintaining focus while working from home.  

**Task**

My goal was to make sure my team and I perform as well as we could under the circumstances. Meaning that we do not feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and demotivated. Moreover, we should have the impression that despite the circumstances, the project seemed achievable. 

**Action**

With the situation and the goal in mind, I decided to heavily invest in my home setup, in order for me to be able to work from home for a long period of time and took the role of Scrum Master. My home setup got upgraded with an ergonomic chair & keyboard, monitor and a massaging pillow to stimulate blood flow. As the Scrum Master I took control over Scrum with the responsibility that the team and I perform as optimal as we could. Besides that, I made efforts to keep the atmosphere fun. 

**Results**

I used to have lower back pain that just would not go away. Thanks to the improvements in my home setup, being mindful of my posture and the messaging pillow this did not go away entirely but it decreased a lot. Which in turn made it possible for me to have no problems sitting for a long period of time to work on the project. I took control over the Sprint Retrospective meetings wherein the team and I discussed what went well, what went wrong and what we longed for. We have had some very useful action points from these meetings. For instance: work in pairs to have better communication / results, turn on your camera to have that layer of interaction available, do not speak over each other, ask more frequently if people need help with something, go more in depth over your work in the standup meetings and be on time for meetings.

**Reflections**

Looking back, I am very happy with the upgrades in my home setup. I think this year would have been more difficult and I would have gotten less things finished without the proper equipment. I am also happy I got to be the Scrum Master during this project. I like to contribute to make the teamwork optimal. Regarding the action points, being late for standups is something that happened often in my case. I think that is because I have a hard time going to sleep, so I wake up tired and its easy to be 5 or 10 minutes late. I also have problems with asking other people more frequently if they need help. I think that is because when I am working on something, I am laser focused on that task and I do not like to get distracted. As for the other action points, I think I complied with them fairly well.
