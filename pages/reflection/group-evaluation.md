# Evaluation on the group as a whole

**Situation**

On the introduction day of the Data Science minor, the available projects were being presented. Afterwards, a teacher (Jeroen Vuurens) asked every student one by one which project they would like to work on. I chose activPAL project because it was about physical movement which interested me more than the other projects. In the end six students wanted to work on the activPAL project so we got grouped up. In this group there was only one person with whom I had worked before. 

**Task**

My intentions were to get to know the other teammates, make an effort to work well with them and contribute to the Scrum process and teamwork as best as I can. 

**Action**

From the beginning I noticed that my teammates were driven and ready to start the project. Everyone including myself participated in Scrum meetings to make sure the project is heading where it is supposed to. Early on it became clear that creating subgroups might be a good choice. By having subgroups and assigning a group to an aspect of the project and closely communicating and sharing information we were able to get a lot done. A bit further in the project we knew that we had to create multiple regression models in order to compare them and pick the best ones. This turned into a small friendly competition which was good for productivity and fun.  

**Results**

It is safe to say that collectively we have achieved quite a bit. We were able to create an activity classification and multiple MET regression models. We also compared the regression models to pick the best ones to use. In the end we even were able to create an application that encapsules the Machine Learning models to make predictions on week data of activPAL accelerometer.

**Reflections**

Our group has come a long way. Unfortunately, we lost one teammate because he quit the Data Science minor and there also was some conflict within the team. However, these issues have been talked about and cleared up. Every project group has its issues. Luckily, we were able to bring many of these issues to light and to talk about them so we all could make an effort to improve upon it. Personally, I think I worked well with the team. Two things I will have to improve on is to be more on time in the mornings and to check in more with teammates to see how they are doing and if they need any help. I always offer help if someone asks it but maybe sometimes a person just has to be offered help.
