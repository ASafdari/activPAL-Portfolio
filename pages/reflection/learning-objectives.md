# Reflection on own learning objectives

**Situation**

I started this minor without any prior knowledge of Machine Learning models and Python. I knew beforehand what Data Science was about, but only very abstractly. I already studied Software Engineering at the Hague University and I was under the impression that Data Science and Software Engineering, although not the same, complement each other nicely. 

**Task**

My goal was to learn what Data Science and Python is about, to learn the fundamentals and get to apply them in a practical, useful and fun project. 

**Action**

From the first week I started by completing the prescribed courses on Datacamp. Datacamp helped me a lot by teaching me the basics of python and useful libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit, Seaborn and Pyplot.  Besides the Datacamp courses I would start to get familiar with the data and literature of my project activPAL. I started by reading and trying to understand some pieces of literature sent to us by Annemieke van Luiten. The pieces of literature would lead me to do research on other related topics. The lectures of the Data Science minor also helped enormously to understand various Data Science and Machine Learning concepts.  

**Results**

From watching the Datacamp courses and lectures I have learned a lot about various topics! From data exploration to model evaluation and everything in between. I would say that I understand the Python programming language a whole lot better now too. Datacamp courses and the lectures taught me the skills I needed to dive into the project data and make sense of them. I was able to create exploratory graphs, execute data-preprocessing and get a model going. But I would not have understood the subject field if it was not for doing literature research. I learned how an accelerometer works, a measuring unit that is used often for measuring energy expenditure (MET) and how this has a relation with movement acceleration data from accelerometers. 

**Reflections**

Overall, I am very happy with what I was able to learn during this minor. I got to learn what I wanted to. At first, I did have some difficulties understanding some concepts in theory, but after repeating to study them it became clearer every time. It also helps that I am not afraid to ask questions when I don't know or understant something. I also experienced the gap between knowing something in theory and trying to apply it in practice. This proved to be challenging. That is also the reason I have multiple versions of the model I created. In the end this all contributes to the learning process and at least now I have multiple versions that show the progress I made.
