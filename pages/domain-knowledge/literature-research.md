# Literature research

I wanted to work on the regression problem so I started to read literature that could be useful for our project. 

Here are the pieces of literature I read in sequential order:

1. Mortazavi, B., Alsharufa, N., Lee, S. I., Lan, M., Sarrafzadeh, M., Chronley, M., & Roberts, C. K. (2013). MET calculations from on-body accelerometers for exergaming movements. 2013 IEEE International Conference on Body Sensor Networks, 1. https://doi.org/10.1109/bsn.2013.6575520
    * Contains formula for MET
    * Contains formula for magnitude of acceleration
    * States that there is a correlation between MET and magnitude of acceleration data from accelerometers

2. Sasaki, J. E., da Silva, K. S., Gonçalves Galdino da Costa, B., & John, D. (2016). Measurement of Physical Activity Using Accelerometers. Computer-Assisted and Web-Based Innovations in Psychology, Special Education, and Health, 33–60. https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-802075-3.00002-4
    * Recommends 60s epochs for adults
    * Contains the same formula for magnitude of acceleration
    * Contains MET ranges for light, moderate, hard and very hard activity intensity
    * States that there is a linear relationship between MET and summation of magnitude of acceleration over an epoch
