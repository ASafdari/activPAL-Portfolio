# Data cleansing
In communication with Annemieke the following issues became clear:
* BMR006 mounted the activPAL horizontally
* BMR027 data files were lost
* BMR035 activPAL stopped working on the first day
* BMR051 activPAL stopped after 4 days

From my own investigation in the data files the following issues became clear:
* BMR025 has no Vyntus file
* BMR028 did not get the files, but the respondent code is in the list of respondents
* BMR029 did not get the files, but the respondent code is in the list of respondents
* BMR051 has no Vyntus file
* BMR060 Vyntus file is empty
* BMR099 Vyntus file does not contain data for walking and running activities
* BMR100 timestamps of activities from the activity file are not existent in the activPAL file 
* All Vyntus files do not contain the timestamps for stairwalking and jumping activities
