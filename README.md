## Research project
### Task definition
In the research plan document I helped to describe the research questions.

### Evaluation
I have not done any substantial work on this topic.

### Conclusions
The conclusion of our research can be found in the research paper and final presentation. I wrote the conclusion in the presentation of week 18.

### Literature research
During the project I have read literature, shared its information with the team so we could use it for the project.

### Explanation of Terminology, Jargon and definitions
In the research paper I explain terms the user should know in the introduction.

## Data preprocessing
### Data exploration
In order to understand the data I created plots about each activity. In addition, I attempted to remove outliers from the activPAL data.

### Data cleansing
The data we got from CBS did not include data of all the respondents. With the data we did get, my team mates and I encountered some issues. So I decided to investigate the data files we received while Colin sent an email to Annemieke regarding some (missing) respondent data files.

### Data preparation
In order to get the data ready to be used in a model, I applied data preprocessing practices on the data.
